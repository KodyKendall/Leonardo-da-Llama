# Leonardo da Llama

Leonardo da Llama is an innovative application that lets you chat with Leonardo about Ruby on Rails and AI. Developed for the Ruby AI Hackathon on July 19th, 2025, this project showcases our gem, `llama_bot_rails`, which utilizes the LlamaBot agent to empower the agent with capabilities like accessing the Rails console. Importantly, this is done securely, ensuring that public phone numbers can safely interact with the agent without gaining admin access to the application.
